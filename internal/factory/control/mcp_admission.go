// D14 capability/submission admission (FW38).
//
// Every MCP request validates capability plus profile/tool/input
// binding, including tools absent from the caller's discovery set.
// Mutations repeat freshness/authority checks at admission.
// Caller-supplied role, child ID or environment variable proves
// nothing: the recorded capability row and the observed run state
// decide. Expiry, stop intent, withdrawal and terminal retirement
// revoke access.
