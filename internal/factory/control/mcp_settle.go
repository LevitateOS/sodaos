// MCP terminal-proposal settlement.
//
// The finish tools are the only result channel. The MCP handler checks
// each new finish with the same mapping this settler uses, so a bad finish
// is refused before anything is recorded. This settler maps one recorded
// terminal proposal to the FinishAssignment store owner and advances the
// receipt recorded→accepted, reusing the repair-chain joint. Builder and
// Fixer finishes wait for their native final checkpoint; nothing else
// parks.
//
// Ordering is crash-safe: FinishAssignment commits first, then the
// receipt advances recorded→accepted under its expected-state guard.
// A crash between the two recovers on the next pass (finished
// assignment plus recorded receipt advances with an already-finished
// note). ErrNotFound from FinishAssignment is ambiguous — a concurrent
// foreign finish, a missing allowance, or a stale input rollback — so
// the settler re-reads the assignment and settles only a genuinely
// terminal one; still-assigned work returns the refusal with its
// receipt left recorded for a later pass. Other transient store errors
// return without touching the receipt, so a later pass retries.
