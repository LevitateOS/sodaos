// Role consumers for MCP finish proposals.
//
// Each finish tool has one synchronous mapping from (assignment, payload) to
// the finished assignment. The MCP handler runs it before anything is
// recorded (CheckMCPTerminalFinish): a refusal goes straight back to the
// worker, which corrects and finishes again. The settler runs the same
// mapping on the recorded proposal and finishes the assignment through the
// joints every result shares (phase binding, decompose semantic settlement,
// repair chain). Nothing here coerces worker prose into settlement facts,
// and no downstream effect runs here: finished typed results advance through
// the existing dispatch, publication, review and adoption consumers.
