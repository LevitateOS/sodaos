// Recorded-terminal enumeration for MCP settlement (Lane A2 drive).
//
// The coordinator settler works one assignment at a time through
// TerminalMCPSubmission/TerminalMCPProposal; this reader supplies
// the bounded work list: assignments whose terminal proposal receipt
// still sits at recorded. Finished assignments remain listed until
// their receipt advances, so a crash between FinishAssignment and
// the receipt CAS recovers on a later pass instead of stranding the
// proposal. Parked FW40 proposals stay listed and visible; the
// settler decides per assignment whether it can prove settlement.
