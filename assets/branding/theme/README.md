# Shared Soda palette

The defining `palette.css` and `tokens.css` now live in
[`LevitateOS/factory`](https://github.com/LevitateOS/factory/tree/main/assets/branding/theme).
Forge resolves them through its `@factory/product` source dependency and keeps
the same native public theme URLs. Edit shared theme values in Factory.

`palette.css` is the source of color values for Soda's frontends. Its light and
dark roles implement the September brutalist design: white/near-black surfaces
and red actions. It contains values, not application selectors, native variable names,
layout, theme switching, or asset URLs.

- Canvas, surface, panel, navigation, text, muted text, border, focus, hover and
  selection are separate roles.
- `action` / `on-action` describe filled primary buttons. `link` / `on-link`
  describe link/accent treatments. Dark links are brighter than filled buttons;
  do not collapse these roles because light mode happens to use the same red.
  Dark pressed/visited link text also stays bright enough for panel backgrounds.
  Native primary ramp steps are separate from accessible link text.
- Mode-qualified values let each application keep its own native theme selection.
- Additional ramps and alpha values supply Forgejo native controls.
  Only distinct extra ramp values are named; adapters reuse semantic values where
  those already supply a ramp step. Alpha bytes remain exact, not rounded mixes.
- Forgejo's existing success/warning roles are retained. Cockpit continues to use
  its native status palette. Git diff, syntax and terminal ANSI colors stay native.

Application adapters map these values to native keys and own control fixes.
Forgejo's theme entries import the palette alongside their native base theme.
Cockpit's frontend entry imports the palette and its PatternFly adapter; the
native branding entry imports installed copies of those same sources.

`scripts/build-soda-extension.ts` bundles the palette into the extension
packages alongside each application's own public assets. Independent build
outputs are intentional; never maintain a second source copy or fetch CSS
from another service.
The source is distributed with the Factory package; no runtime theme service or
CSS generator is involved.

`tokens.css` defines the shared product spacing, typography and semantic color
tokens over that palette. Forgejo's `components.css` and the standalone Factory
`frontend/factory/styles/base.css` import this same file. Document theme selection
and native Forgejo-variable mappings stay in their host adapters.

When changing colors, run the palette contrast and packaging tests, then render
both applications in light, dark and automatic modes. Test actual controls and
focus states, not just custom-property declarations. Preserve explicit theme
choices under the opposite system preference. Test staging/import paths separately
from rendered colors; their failure modes are different.
