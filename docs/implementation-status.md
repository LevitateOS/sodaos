# Implementation handoff

Source-only: no builds, tests, type checks, installed validation or artifact publication have run.

## Baseline

- New backend and privileged integration: Go; no Rust subsystem without a concrete need. Retained Cockpit frontend: TypeScript/React.
- Go 1.26.7 (predecessor source baseline); HTMX 2.0.10 vendored from its npm distribution with license.
- Host candidate: Fedora CoreOS stable 44.20260817.3.2, reported for x86_64/aarch64 by the upstream stable stream metadata. Native compatibility remains unverified.
- Predecessor source: local `soda-os` commit `bc1d3e0dbec48dfaa6a20f9d0453ad3e4cdf353c`. No changes are made in that repository; Updates remain excluded.

## M01 — source implemented

Go server/configuration, embedded canonical branding, HTMX source, initial templates, narrow process runner reused from predecessor, and authored configuration/server/process tests. Application features follow in subsequent milestones; this foundation is not a completed product.

Build: not run. Validation: not run.

## M02 — source implemented

SQLite via modernc.org/sqlite v1.58.0 (upstream module metadata), schema and concrete store, hashed session tokens and single-use OAuth state storage. Startup opens the persistent database. Tests authored, not run; go.sum/dependency resolution remains a later build input step.
