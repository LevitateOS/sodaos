# Soda environment/access API

The root React `dashboard/` and its duplicate Forgejo workflow adapters have been
removed. This guide describes the **retained Go source**, not an installed rollout
or a completed Sodaspaces button/drawer. Native Forgejo owns collaboration/account/
administration pages. The old Go/HTMX frontend is also removed; no Soda browser UI
remains in source while supported Sodaspaces integration is still pending.

## Browser namespace

Source now mounts the API and OAuth routes at **`/-/soda/` on `forgejo_url`**.
Paths below are relative to that prefix: `/api/session` means
`/-/soda/api/session`, and `/login` means `/-/soda/login`. The direct loopback
backend still answers `/healthz` and redirects `/`; unprefixed API/login/callback
paths are not aliases. Caddy forwards only the Soda prefix unchanged and leaves
native Forgejo routes upstream-owned. This foundation is source-tested, not
installed or a completed authenticated drawer. Actor-context guards and
repository-bound OAuth return handling now exist in the backend; native-page
context capture and the real browser/proxy round trip remain unimplemented/unproven.

## Expected actor

Protected calls require **`X-Soda-Expected-User-ID`**, a canonical positive decimal
Forgejo user ID (signed 64-bit range). Missing, duplicate or malformed values return
`400 invalid_actor_context`; disagreement with the authenticated Soda session
returns `403 identity_mismatch` before the handler runs. This header does **not**
authenticate a native browser session, choose the acting account or grant authority.
Normal session, CSRF, grant and operation-specific authorization checks still apply.

`GET /api/session` alone may omit the header to inspect the current Soda identity
and CSRF token. If supplied there, the header is still checked. The native-page
caller must compare its signed-in stable ID with that session and the fresh
`GET /api/forgejo/me` result, not silently substitute the bootstrap identity when
they differ. Explicit Soda logout also uses the expected **Soda** actor and CSRF;
it does not sign out Forgejo or Linux. The retained connection probe checks its
supplied fixture username against bootstrap before using the actor ID.

## Retained operations

| Endpoint | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/session` | Soda acting identity, CSRF token, explicit Soda operator flag and configured Forgejo browser URL |
| `POST /api/session/logout` | `{}`; delete Soda session/grant and expire its cookie; not global Forgejo/Linux logout |
| `GET/PATCH /api/me/preferences` | Soda-only display name; PATCH `{display_name}` |
| `GET/POST /api/me/development-keys` | Own development-access public keys; POST `{public_key}`; not native Git key management |
| `GET /api/forgejo/me` | Bounded acting-grant identity inspection; native stable ID must match the Soda session |
| `GET /api/environments` | Existing trusted-team Soda reservations; not private Git authorization |
| `POST /api/environments` | `{owner,repository}`; acting-grant native human-owner check, reservation, actual native create; no implicit join |
| `GET /api/environments/{id}` | Provisioning record, nullable live observation, own login and current-authority hint; incomplete reservations remain inspectable |
| `POST /api/environments/{id}/join` | `{}`; own identity/public keys, real fixed native account operation, membership only after confirmed success |
| `GET /api/environments/{id}/members` | Current native human/org owner or explicit Soda operator sees permitted members; otherwise own membership only |
| `GET /api/environments/{id}/connection` | Own membership required; current IP/running state and fixed public Ed25519 host key/fingerprint; `routing_verified:false` |

Environment detail/members report `authority_unavailable` when ownership cannot be
verified. Failure withholds elevated visibility without discarding own membership/
connection access. Cached `owner_id` is historical, not authorization. Resolve current
native ownership by stored repository ID and native organization `is_owner`, not
`is_admin`. These reads do not remap Linux identities/permissions or revoke prior
access. Organization-owned **creation** remains unsupported; do not infer otherwise
from the current-owner visibility check on transferred repositories.

The future repository-context button/drawer endpoint has **not** been implemented.
Do not invent an endpoint, authenticated embedding mechanism or shared cookie from
this retained API. The leading plan owns that next source slice.

## Browser/session/security contracts

**Known source gaps:** new joins still lack repository authorization, and in-flight
OAuth callbacks can issue a new session after Soda logout. The
[logout fix](sodaspaces-plan.md#oauth-callback-and-logout-fix) and
[repository authorization fix](sodaspaces-plan.md#repository-authorization-fix)
are not implemented; refresh/logout tests do not establish callback cancellation safety.

- `GET /` redirects to configured Forgejo home. `GET /login` accepts optional
  `repository_id` and `expected_user_id` with the same positive-ID representation;
  omit unavailable context, never send zero. IDs are stored with the single-use
  PKCE transaction, not forwarded as provider authorization parameters. Nonempty
  or repeated `return_to` remains refused. Errors are plain text, not templates.
- Callback checks the fresh provider subject against the stored expected user
  before changing profiles/sessions/grants. Mismatch returns 403, consumes the
  transaction and preserves existing Soda state; sign in again explicitly.
  With actual repository consent, the callback resolves the stored repository ID
  through the acting grant, then builds its current native path plus `#sodaspaces`
  under the configured HTTPS origin. Missing/inaccessible/invalid context falls
  back to Forgejo home. Callback-supplied IDs/URLs, provider URLs and the historical
  `return_path` column never select the destination.
- Schema v4 adds only two default-zero OAuth context ID columns; migrated pending
  transactions have no context and return home. Grant encryption/keys and project
  records are unchanged. Auth queries are limited to 8 KiB; malformed encoding,
  duplicate state/code and oversized code/state fail closed. Login/callback use
  `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` to keep query data out of subsequent referrers.
- New login requests only `read:user read:repository read:organization` for current
  callers; `administration=1` no longer requests extra consent. Existing grants are
  not silently revoked or rewritten; scopes come from upstream introspection.
  A redirect does not establish/transfer a native Forgejo session.
- Cookies are host-only, Secure/HttpOnly/SameSite=Lax, scoped to `/-/soda/` and
  named `__Secure-sodaspaces-session` / `__Secure-sodaspaces-oauth`. Duplicate,
  empty or oversized Soda cookies fail closed. Native Forgejo and old `soda_session`
  / `soda_oauth` cookies are not authentication inputs. Cutover requires a fresh
  Soda login; old pending browser flows restart rather than gain a callback alias.
  Cookie paths do not isolate mutually untrusted applications on the same origin.
- Keep single-use state, PKCE, callback binding, cookie protections, session rotation,
  the existing provider/session-bound grant encryption, serialized refresh and
  logout-winning grant refresh. Callback/logout finalization still needs the fix
  above. No second password or provider-role authority.
- API IDs are decimal strings. Unsafe methods require the exact configured `ForgejoURL` Origin,
  same-origin fetch metadata when present, a matching `X-CSRF-Token` and UTF-8 JSON.
  Bodies are bounded to 64 KiB; unknown/trailing fields/data fail. Outputs/errors
  are bounded and sanitized; no credentials in errors or browser responses.
- No generic Forgejo proxy, browser-selected base URL, operator-token fallback,
  automatic retry of uncertain mutations or HTML result masquerading as JSON.
  Unknown/removed API paths return JSON 404; `/app/` no longer serves a SPA.
- Native creation/account or result-persistence failure retains honest incomplete
  state. Do not recreate, prune, replace or claim a failed join succeeded.
- New public keys are installed at explicit join; no automatic later propagation,
  Linux offboarding, Git authorization or client-routing proof is promised.

## Native-page and stale-tab boundary

The backend sees a Soda session and a declared page actor, **not Forgejo's live
browser session**. It catches a changed Soda cookie versus the old page actor;
it cannot detect native-only login/logout in another tab while the Soda session
is unchanged. The pending drawer must discard stale reads and reload native page
context on resume/BFCache restoration before exposing actions, then compare the
page/session/provider IDs. An anonymous or mismatched page offers explicit sign-in,
not automatic account switching or mutation replay. Native logout is not global
Soda logout; do not claim atomic cross-system session revocation. Browser behavior
and this caller wiring still require implementation and real verification.

## Retained callers, tests and packaging

`internal/web/{api,environments_api,environment_authority,provider,auth}.go` and
`internal/{forgejo,store,host}/` retain the actual integration/security code.
Templates, static assets, form handlers, repository/People pickers and their dedicated
clients/tests are removed. `/profile`, `/people`, `/keys`, `/projects`, their form/
join routes and `/logout` return 404; use the protected JSON logout operation.
The Go command/container/service/database keep their names. There is no embedded
or external Soda frontend; `/healthz` remains independent of browser rendering.

Focused Go tests retain CSRF/input/error, provider/grant/race, native ownership,
create/join/reservation, key and persistence coverage. Negative route tests ensure
retired forge adapters do not reach provider/helper operations. React-specific DOM
and browser orchestration tests were removed with their callers; their historical
source and U08 logs remain in Git/ignored evidence. Native SSH/Git/workload/lifecycle
and Cockpit tests remain. Sodaspaces browser replacement coverage is pending, not
inferred from historical React results.

[current plan](sodaspaces-plan.md), [frontend integration](forgejo-frontend-integration.md)
and [handoff](implementation-status.md) for current scope and performed checks.
