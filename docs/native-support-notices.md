# Native support provenance and notices

Support code was selectively adapted from [Soda OS](https://github.com/LevitateOS/soda-os/tree/bc1d3e0dbec48dfaa6a20f9d0453ad3e4cdf353c), revision `bc1d3e0dbec48dfaa6a20f9d0453ad3e4cdf353c`:

- `internal/acceptance/qmp.go` and its tests: QMP negotiation and request/response handling.
- `internal/acceptance/remote.go`, `command.go`, `evidence.go`, `processes.go`, `cleanup.go`, `qemu.go`: literal transport, evidence/error boundaries and exact child ownership ideas, adapted to the current core contract.
- `internal/build/release/inspection.go`: artifact/platform identity techniques only; no release record graph.
- `scripts/soda-release-executor`: fresh checkout and exact-revision phase boundaries only; no publisher, account or login-shell installation.
- `tests/acceptance/check-native-service-ordering.sh`: ordering observations adapted to current units.

The predecessor checkout remains unchanged. No new license is assigned to inherited code. Upstream source attribution and existing third-party licenses remain applicable. This file is not a substitute for those licenses or permission to relicense assets.

Tea's upstream MIT license is delivered beside this notice and inside the project image. The GitHub runner payload retains its upstream license files. Other packages and container layers retain their upstream notices/licenses; the input record identifies resolved bytes. Canonical Soda branding is reused, not redrawn or relicensed. See the source repository's `docs/branding.md`, `docs/predecessor-reuse.md`, `docs/project-clis.md` and dependency locks.

The deployment bundle is application/service content for upstream Fedora CoreOS, **not a bootc host image, installer ISO, preinstalled disk, signed release or product acceptance certificate**. Instance provisioning and credentials are never bundle content.
